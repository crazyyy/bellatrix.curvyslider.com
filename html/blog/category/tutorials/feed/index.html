		<description><![CDATA[<p>How to Install WordPress is very easy. You can easily read this. And learn how to install WordPress. And of course after how to install WordPress, you can build your site.</p>
<p>Before starting to how to install WordPress let's see requirements ;</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP version 5.6 or greater</li>
<li>MySQL version 5.6 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.0 or greater</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="more-739"></span></p>
<p>These are the official requirements of WordPress. But there are some more ;</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s really it. We recommend <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> or <a href="http://nginx.org/">Nginx</a> as the most robust and featureful server for running WordPress, but any server that supports PHP and MySQL will do. That said, we can’t test every possible environment and <a href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/">each of the hosts on our hosting page</a> supports the above and more with no problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Said officially for WordPress requirements. And just one more note ;</p>
<blockquote><p>Note: If you are in a legacy environment where you only have older PHP or MySQL versions, WordPress also works with PHP 5.2.4+ and MySQL 5.0+, but these versions have reached official End Of Life and as such <strong>may expose your site to security vulnerabilities</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are the main requirements for how to install WordPress. And you can read this information at</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/</a></p>
<h2>HOW TO INSTALL WORDPRESS</h2>
<p>If you get your server ready, you can start to how to install WordPress. There are different ways for installation. Some hosting services, have the auto installers for WordPress. But those are mostly one click installation. Which means, if you have a one click installer on your server, you can install WordPress just by "clicking".</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-485 size-medium" src="http://bellatrix.curvyslider.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/laptop-1149412_1920-380x275.jpg" alt="How To Install WordPress" width="380" height="275" /></p>
<p>From now on, we will focus on servers without one click. Which means, you have to install WordPress. Doing it is not that hard actually.</p>
<h2>WORDPRESS DATABASE</h2>
<p>WordPress uses a database. So first thing we will do is to get our database ready. If you are on cPanel, you can easily build a new database. Just login to your cPanel, and build a new database. Make sure you also set a user for this database. We will use this database name and user information while how to install WordPress.</p>
<h2>DOWNLOADING WORDPRESS</h2>
<p>After we got our database ready, we will download the WordPress. You can always download the latest version of the WordPress from here ;</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/download/</a></p>
<p>When you download the file from there, unzip it. You should see all the files and directories of the WordPress. It should be something like this ;</p>
<ul>
<li>/wp-admin</li>
<li>/wp-content</li>
<li>/wp-includes</li>
<li>... files...</li>
</ul>
<p>Those 3 directories are not our subject right now. But you should see these directories. And of course you should see a lot of files there. There is no file named as "file". I've typef "...files.." to refer there are some other things in this directory.</p>
<h2>UPLOADING WORDPRESS</h2>
<p>Now we are going to upload those files. And after that we will get another step done. And of course be ready for how to install WordPress. To upload files, you should connect to your server via FTP. You can get your FTP details from your server. When you logged into your server via FTP, look for www directory</p>
<p>/www</p>
<p>Then upload the files there. Structure should look like this ;</p>
<ul>
<li>/www/wp-admin</li>
<li>/www/wp-content</li>
<li>/www/wp-includes</li>
<li>/www/... files...</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we got our database ready. And we got our files ready. Now let's start to how to install WordPress.</p>
<h2>STARTING INSTALLATION</h2>
<p>Now go to your site by using your favorite browser. You should see the how to install WordPress screen there. Enter the required information to start how to install WordPress. Then it will complete the how to install WordPress. And now you got your WordPress installed and ready to use.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-703" src="http://bellatrix.curvyslider.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/screenshot-bellatrix.curvyslider.com-2016-03-25-21-05-33-540x307.png" alt="Bellatrix Home Main" width="540" height="307" /></p>
